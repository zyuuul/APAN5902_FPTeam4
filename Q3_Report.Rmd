# datatable(crash[COLLISION_ID == 4364011])
#seems like ther are incidents where one car hit another stationary car, and computer assigned a same collision id to them(因为vehicle table and person table 是从crash的附加项，这意味着每一次填表会得到一个collision id 这也意味着在这个事故中相撞的两个人有一个没有报警 一个报了)
#maybe due to the fact that the MV104-AN form has a potential second car involved column

# Q3{.tabset}
Temporal Trends in Accidents: How do accident frequencies vary over temporal factors, e.g. time of day, day of the week, month, to uncover trends and potential correlations?

#Output

Accidents by Day of Week
```{r q3_output1}
params$q3_plot1
```

Accidents by Month
```{r q3_output2}
params$q3_plot2
```

Accidents by Hour
```{r q3_output3}
params$q3_plot3
```
